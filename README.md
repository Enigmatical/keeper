# Dungeon Keeper (Level 1.0)

## Hello, GMs!

Built for **Pathfinder** campaigns, this tool has been designed to help with organizing everything from **simple one-off adventures** to **epic, sweeping campaigns** allowing you to focus on what you do best - **create**.

## Features

* Simple, Campaign Organization
> Campaigns are organized into multiple tiers to allow for deep organization.  Each Campaign can consist of multiple Acts.  Each Act consists of multiple Quests.  And, finally, each Quest consists of multiple Tasks.  Tasks are host to a number of Encounters ranging from Combat, Conversations, Traps, etc.
        
* Multiple Parties and Multiple Campaign Saves
> Multiple Parties can be set up and each one can have multiple saves for a particular Campaign.  Play through the same Campaign repeatedly using different characters, different players, different choices - and lose track of nothing.

* Maintain your own Bestiary and NPC database
> The Bestiary and NPCs can be built and used across multiple Campaigns allowing for returning characters and enemies.

* Split into two purposes:  Manage & Adventure
> Manage is built for larger desktop displays and contains all the tools one would need to create a flush, complex Campaign.  Adventure is built for tablets, with simple button actions to quickly access the stores of information you've written.
